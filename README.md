# Why? 
We chose to learn Feathers after getting a brief introduction to this minimal web application framework from a former WDI student 

# What problem does it solve?
Feathers makes it easy to create scalable REST APIs and real-time applications. 

# Why does one use it? 
Developers use it because it's easy to understand and allows quick generation of full-stack apps. 

# What are the alternatives to Feathers?
Sails.js, Derby, Meteor are among the top 15 alternatives listed for 2019. (sources: https://www.slant.co/options/14594/alternatives/~feathersjs-alternatives

# What is the history of this technology? 
The founders of Feathers (David Luecke and Eric Kryski), wanted to solve the issue of apps becoming overly complex when using MVC frameworks. They started to explore different approaches to building web applications in 2010 and since then have found an efficient solution with the creation of Feathers.

# Our thoughts on Feathers
The documentation was really easy to follow. After creating apps with Express, we found that Feathers greatly expedited and simplified the process of creating apps--specifically, authentication, CRUD, controllers and routes. 

We created a simple chat app using NeDB and the frontend framework of Feathers and future steps would be to implement Feathers using React and MongoDB. 

We did not run into conceptual hurdles when learning Feathers because it simplifies a framework that we were already familiar with.
